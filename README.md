== Treinenweb Admin V2 Mockup ==

This is a mockup of the brand new administrationpanel of Treinenweb, created in the LTE2 Admin-template (see also: https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/index2.html)

This is for only for development purposes and it's NOT a fully working adminpanel.
All pages what you can see and reach are static pages wich dynamically loaded by PHP.

You can install the assets (the whole AdminLTE2 package) with this command:

composer require "almasaeed2010/adminlte=~2.4"
